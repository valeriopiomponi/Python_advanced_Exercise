# üß© Group Exercise ‚Äî Image Processing Pipeline with Git and Python

## üéØ Objective
In this exercise, you will work in a **group of three students** to build a simple **data processing pipeline** using Python and GitHub.  
Each student will be responsible for one part of the workflow ‚Äî from reading an image and converting it to JSON, to extracting features, and finally visualizing results.

---

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Group Setup

1. **Create a GitHub repository** for your group project.  
   - The repository name should follow this format:  
     ```
     data-infra-name-of-the-group
     ``` 

2. They push the cloned content to their group repo:

   git remote remove origin
   git remote add origin https://github.com/...../data-infra-name-of-the-group.git
   git push -u origin main

3. Each student should:
   - **Clone** the repository.
   - **Create and work on their own branch**, named according to their assigned task:
     - `metadata_extractor_module`
     - `json_cleaner_module`
     - `visualizer_module`

## üß† Tasks

### üß© Task 1 ‚Äî Metadata Extractor Module

**Responsible student:** Branch `metadata_extractor_module`

1. Update semmeta/metadata_extractor_module.py in order to define a **Python class** that:
   - Reads the `name_of_image.tif` image from imgs folder.
   - Converts the image data and metadata into a **JSON structure**.

2. Save the resulting JSON file in the repository (e.g., `output/name_of_image_raw.json`).

**Suggested libraries:** `Pillow`, `numpy`, `json`

---

### üß© Task 2 ‚Äî Json Cleaner Module

**Responsible student:** Branch `json_cleaner_module`

1. Update the semmeta/json_cleaner_module.py in order to write a **Python class** that:
  
   - Reads the `output/name_of_image_raw.json` file created in Task 1.
   - Filters out all features whose values are `"null"` or `None`.
   - Saves the new cleaned JSON file as `output/name_of_image_cleaned.json`.
  
2. Ensure your code handles missing keys gracefully (`output/name_of_image_cleaned.json` should have a key and a value for each feature.)

**Suggested libraries:** `json`, `pandas`

---

### üß© Task 3 ‚Äî Extraction and Visualization

**Responsible student:** Branch `visualizer_module`

1. Update semmeta/visualizer_module.py  i order to write **Python script or class** that:
   - From `output/name_of_image_cleaned.json` extract the following features: AP_WD; AP_BEAM_TIME; AP_IMAGE_PIXEL_SIZE; AP_HOLDER_HEIGHT, AP_BEAM_CURRENT, AP_HOLDER_DIAMETER
   - Plots the original `.tif` image.
   - Displays a table (or printed DataFrame) showing the **keys and values** of the extracted features:
  
**Suggested libraries:** `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `Pillow`
  
### üß© Task 4 ‚Äî Execution

Update the main.py file to write a function that allows executing the program by: 
   - asking for the name of the `name_of_image.tif` file** as input (e.g., via `input()` or a command-line argument).
   - calling all modules from previous tasks.



---

## üîÑ Collaboration and Integration

- Each student works independently on their branch.
- After finishing, open a **Pull Request** to merge your branch into the main branch.
- Review each other‚Äôs code before merging.
- Ensure that the final main branch contains a **complete, working pipeline**.
